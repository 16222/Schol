    Welcome to Daniel Loubser's 2020 13DTP web-project website.
    <br>
    It's not much, but it's home.
    The purpose of this website is to access a premade Azure Active Directory and then pull information from it.
    Right now, all that can be pulled is user information.
    <br>
    To get started, click the login button and login with the prepared account I've given you.
